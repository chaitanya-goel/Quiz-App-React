#Quiz App
<br>
I developed a Quiz App using React to provide an interactive platform for answering multiple-choice questions. The app dynamically displays questions, tracks user responses, and provides immediate feedback by highlighting whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect.

Key features include:

Real-time Answer Validation: Each answer is visually highlighted as correct or incorrect.
State Management: React's state is used to handle the quiz's progress and scoring.
Dynamic Question Rendering: Questions and options are displayed dynamically from a data source.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean design ensures an engaging and responsive user experience.
This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive React applications with logical state handling and user feedback mechanisms.
